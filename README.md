Guidelines for Grading Projects and Report Structure/Format
To Students
GENERAL RUBRIC
The guidelines for grading the project are as follows:
- Cover page that lists the name(s) of all members in the group, course#, section#, and semester

0. A 100-150-word Abstract and 1-2-page overall Introduction to the Report. (5pts)
1. Discussion on Design Approach, including block-diagrams or software architecture of the simulator.(5 pts)
2. Discussion on Implementation Modules, including snippets of significant sections of code and the
‘experimental’ design (different permutations of runs of the simulation). (25 pts)
3. Discussion on the Simulation itself, including selected screenshots of the simulation runs that show
the actual execution(s) of the simulator. (20 points)
4. Discussion of Tabulated Data from the simulation results and the corresponding graphs that
highlight the correlation among the various metrics listed in the Project Specs. (20pts).
5. Conclusions / Summary of findings. (5 pts)
6. Demonstration (20 points) -- (A 3-5-minute audio-video capture of a demo of the simulator,
showing the compilation phase and the runs for all the permutations/scenarios, submitted as ONE
.mp4 file along with the Final Report.)
Notes:
The Progress Report of Part 1, and the Final Report of Part 2, content must be structured and
